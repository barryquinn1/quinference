## Why use Q-RaP?

Businesses are experiencing an unstoppable *digital transformation*, and we as a Management school most keep pace to allow our students and staff to remain **credible and relevant**.  To this extent we have build a high-performance cloud computing platform for teaching and research. 

*Q*ueen's Management School *R*emote *a*nalytics *P*latform is a high-performance stack of [open science](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/open-science-basics/open-concepts-and-principles) computing technologies which we use to promote rigour, accountability and reproducibility in digital analytics.

This stack is the largest clouding computing infrastructure in the [Queen's University Belfast](). 

### What is Q-RaP?
Running [enterprise-level RStudio software](https://www.rstudio.com/products/team/), Q-RaP allows the school to teach statistics and advanced analytics, using both `R` and `Python`,in a frictionless and agile manner.  There is no more need for a static computer lab, all students need is a web browser and a [growth mindset](https://www.youcubed.org/resources/mindset-video/).   

>The platform is split into two components based on user sophistication

|**Usage**|**Explanation**|**Set up**|
|---|---|---|
|Foundational| Used to teach 200+ students concurrently on PGT modules|[RStudio Cloud Q-RaP](https://sso.rstudio.cloud/q-rap) using single-sign-in with QUB credentials|
|Advanced| Using for PhD training, and advance data visualisation|High-Performance Cloud Computing Suite hosted in Azure and managed by [QMS DevOps Team](https://quinference.com). Access upon request with this [form]()|

The goal of Q-RaP is to embed computation as a central tenet in the ciricula, allowing students to do something interesting with data in the first 10 minutes of the first class.
