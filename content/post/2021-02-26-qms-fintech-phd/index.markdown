## Overview

The unstoppable algorithmic transformation of financial services has seen the financial technology (FinTech) industry surge from the sidelines to the [mainstream](https://www.ft.com/content/89ea3d5d-cd29-46ec-88f1-67729b09a7c2?shareType=nongift). [FinTech is broadly defined as a permanent technology revolution that is changing the way we do finance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-kalifa-review-of-uk-fintech).  While narrow artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which uses rule-based algorithms, has dominated the fast-paced automation of tasks and finance, the next wave of automation will be digitising judgment calls.  Given that finance professionals have an essential fiduciary duty towards their clients, the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) in finance has highlighted some critical risks around trust, overfitting, lack of interpretability, biased inputs and unethical use of data.

This funded PhD offers a unique opportunity to understand how digital innovations affect a highly valued financial service provision experience. Using access to member-level *big* data this project seeks to understand the risk and opportunities AI and ML innovation technologies present to the financial service delivery and operational effectiveness. Specifically, the research project addresses three broad areas:
1.	Regulatory technology and the effective management of financial institution stability and growth.
2.	ML innovations to default risk prediction and the development of new products.
3.	Customer experience innovations using AI and ML techniques and digital platforms.

The successful candidate with be jointly supervised by Professor Donal McKillop and myself. Donal has published extensively on credit unions including work on their ownership structure, governance, regulatory change, capital adjustment and merger and acquisition behavior. Donal is currently Director of Centre for Not-for-profit and Public-sector Research (CNPR) at Queen’s University and Chair of the Chairperson of the Credit Union CEO Forum (CU CEO Forum.ie).
