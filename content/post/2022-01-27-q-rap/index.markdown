All types of industry are experiencing an unstoppable algorithmic transformation, and we as a Management school most keep pace to remain credible and relevant.  To this extent we have build a remote analytics platform in the cloud. *Q*ueens Management School *R*emote *a*nalytics *P*latform. (aka Q-RaP) is a high-performance suite of cloud computing technologies which we using to teach students about open science analytics and statistical inference. This is the largest clouding computing infrastructure in the University. 

Running [enterprise-level server software](https://www.rstudio.com/products/team/), Q-RaP allows the school to teach computer age statistical inference in a frictionless and agile manner.  There is no more need for a static computer lab, all students need is a web browser and a [growth mindset](https://www.youcubed.org/resources/mindset-video/).   

The goal of Q-RaP is to embed computation as a central tenet in the ciricula, allowing students to do something interesting with data in the first 10 minutes of the first class.  The platform is use to teaching students how to produce responsible analytics using both Python and R programming language.

For example, our student managed fund uses the platform to teaching and promote investment management:
