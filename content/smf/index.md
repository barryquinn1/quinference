My passionate for student development lead me to establish a student managed fund in 2014. In academia student managed funds are not a new thing, but have a proven track record in supercharging employability. In the beginning this was run as a virtual money fund, with a small cohort of enthusiastic students. In 2015, with the help of [Dr Alan Hanna](https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/alan-hanna) and the Alumni office, we establish a real money fund. Principled on experiental learning, professionalism, corporate engagement, the fund strives to improve student employability by building confident humility in student's financial knowledge.  From these early days, the fund has grown from strength to strength. 

The academic year 2019-2020 threw up some unique challenges for our band of budding investment professional in the SMF.  Once again we were humbled by the work, creativity and innovations of this academic year's cohort.  This culminated in an excellent Annual report.  While learning and employability are the primary goals of the SMF, student's are outperforming their FTSE350 benchmark in most years.  

Below are some video highlights of this year's annual report.
