I teach students using experiential learning to encourage experimentation and produce credible analytics. My goal is to develop students' employability, resilience, confident humility and empirical curiosity. I run postgraduate degrees in quantitative finance, financial technology and data science and teaches graduate-level statistics for time series, financial machine learning and algorithmic trading and investment. I designed and direct a high-performance cloud computing analytics platform for teaching and research in the areas of business analytics, econometrics, AI and machine learning in the Management School. I research to feed my curiosity and build confident humility, advocating the responsible use of cutting edge statistics and AI techniques. My research interests are the rule of law and risk analytics in the areas of Banking, FinTech, Football, and Credit unions.
