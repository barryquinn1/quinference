I help teach students to become more prepared for the future.  I teach them important skills like experimenting and looking at data to make better decisions. I teach them things that will help them get a job, be strong and brave, be humble, and be curious about the world.  I help them learn about numbers and how to use technology for finance and data science.  I do research to stay curious, humble, learn new things, and to help people make smart decisions about finance and other topics. I teach and research in advanced topics like statistics, computer science, and econometrics.
